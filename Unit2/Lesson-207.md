Lesson 2.07 — Scope & Pseudocode
====================================================================================================

Overview
--------
### Objectives — _Students will be able to…_
- **Identify** the scope of a variable.
- **Identify** common scope errors

### Assessments — _Students will…_
- **Complete** a worksheet

### Homework — _Students will…_
- **Read** BJP 2.4 “Pseudocode”
- **Complete** self-check questions 31-33 (4<sup>th</sup> edition 34-36)
- **Check class notes** for completion, adding daily summaries if needed
  - Students may use the book to supplement their notes if needed.


Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Projector and computer**
- **Whiteboard and** **markers**
- **Classroom copies** of [WS 2.7]

Since most of today’s lesson follows WS 2.7, you should have read through the worksheet. You may
prefer to delete the notes from the worksheet (so it is only a sheet of exercises) if you are
working on developing note-taking skills in your classroom. We recommend leaving these sections in
for ELL classrooms, so your students can focus on syntax rules instead of translating what they are
hearing to vocabulary they need to then write in their notebooks.


Pacing Guide
------------
| Section                    | Total Time |
|----------------------------|-----------:|
| Bell-work and attendance   |       5min |
| Introduction to scope      |      10min |
| Worksheet activity         |      15min |
| Introduction to pseudocode |       5min |
| Programming Project 1      |      20min |


Procedure
---------

Scope is another challenging topic, so we’ve prepared a student handout that diagrams scope.
Encourage students to take supplemental notes in their notebook and on the handout.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Introduction to Scope \[10 minutes\]

1. Using WS 2.7, walk students through the sample illustration of **scope** and scope-related error.

   Before you explain that brackets define scope, ask students to tell you why they think the error
   in the example. They may be able to spot the scope from their reading last night.

2. Have students copy the rules for scope off the worksheet and into their notebooks. Students
   should head the page “The 4 Commandments of Scope,” and illustrate, circle, highlight, star, or
   otherwise emphasize these rules so they are easy to find in the notebook throughout the year.

   - Transcribing these notes is not busywork—in the ELL classroom, this slows down the pace and
     allows students additional time to process the language and study the concepts conveyed. This
     is a good strategy for all classes (ELL or not)!

At this point, your class may be raring to get started on the rest of the assignment without your
help. If they are, great!

If they are still seeming uncertain about how to apply rules of scope, walk through Exercise 1a and
ask the class to explain to you how/why you know that scope a begins and ends where it does.

### Worksheet Activity \[15 minutes\]

1. Have students work independently or in pairs on WS 2.7.

   a. Remind students to refer to their 4 Commandments when searching for errors.

   b. Play music quietly in the background to encourage focus and discourage chatting.

   c. If students are struggling with the exercise, allow them to pair up. Encourage students to
      trade papers and look for errors.

2. If more 25% or more of the class is struggling, return to whole group with the stipulation that
   students who get it may continue working independently.

3. Review answers as a whole group. Make sure to call the variables boxed in Exercise 1 “local
   variables,” and ask students to explain what makes them localized.

### Introduction to pseudocode \[5 minutes\]
Using an example that was popular during the last week of class, show students how to plan a program
using **pseudocode**.

### Programming Project 1 \[20 minutes\]
As a class, begin planning a program to answer Programming Project 1.

The challenging task of writing the pseudocode and/or structure diagram (you should always require
one, both, or a combination of the two) is the most important part of this exercise, so avoid the
temptation of giving students too much guidance.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
It is likely that students will not finish the programming project during class. You can reduce
student stress by setting the expectation that they submit complete pseudocode by the end of class;
not a completed program. You may extend the program for advanced students, and ask that they submit
an entire program (complete with class header).
