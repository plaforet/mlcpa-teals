- **Identify** 'next steps' to learn more about computer science
- **List** the class expectations and what is required of them.

### Assessments — _Students will…_
- **Demonstrate** Plug-In and Un-Plug procedures
- **Log in and submit** a sample problem in Practice-It

### Homework — _Students will…_
- **Visit** http://www.pokemon.com and play a few games or **play** Pokémon on a
  gaming system
- **Visit** http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net to familiarize yourself with the Pokémon franchise


Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Projector and computer**
- **Student Computers** with Eclipse installed
- **Classroom copies** of [WS 1.1.1] and [WS 1.1.2]
- **USB Drives** for each student (if applicable to school)
- **Handout/Slide Deck** demonstrating file submission procedure

If your school does not have a designated IT specialist available to install Eclipse on the
classroom computers, **WS 1.1.1** offers step-by-step installation directions, with screenshots.
If your students have computers at home, or if your school loans them laptops for homework and
labs, you can print out copies of WS 1.1.1 for your students so they can install Eclipse on their
home computers.

If your school distributes USB drives, model best practices by **wearing your USB drive** on your
ID lanyard or keychain. Students will lose and/or forget their drives unless they are attached to
another object they use daily!

Since all instructors have different preferences and requirements for file uploads/sharing, we
have not included a procedure for file submission. You should prepare a handout or slide deck
**demonstrating your procedure for submitting work**, and have students send you a sample file to
assess understanding of your procedure. 10 minutes of this lesson have been reserved for you to
teach these procedures.

Procedure
---------

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Classroom Introduction \[20 minutes\]

1. Using the slide deck as a base (edit the deck to fit your needs):
   - Poll your class to learn their names, experience, and rationale behind taking the course.
   - Go over background information of the computer science field.
   - Go over class expectations and information.
   - Touch on school requirements (varies) _e.g._ syllabus.

2. Class icebreakers (varies school to school).

### Plug-In & Un-Plug Procedure \[10 minutes\]

1. Using WS 1.1.2, model the steps for:
   - Opening Eclipse and a workspace
   - Creating and saving a program
   - Ejecting the USB (if applicable)

2. Have students demonstrate the Plug In and Un-Plug procedures for you before you move on to the
   Practice-It exercise.

If your classroom has a projector hooked up to the teacher’s computer, project each step as you
model it for the students.

Wait until all students have completed a step before moving on to another step.

Expect this exercise to take 10 minutes or longer.

### Practice-It \[10 minutes\]

1. Using WS 1.1.2, model the steps for creating a Practice-It account. Since you will probably
   already have an account, select a student account to use as a model.

2. Have all students submit a Practice-It problem to demonstrate that they know how to use
   Practice-It.

Wait until all students have completed a step before moving on to another step.

If you have extra time in class, introduce a “Scavenger Hunt” on Practice-It, and have students find:
   - Where their account information is located
   - Where a record of their completed problems are located
   - Where the 3rd Self-Check problem for Chapter 7 is located

### File Submission Procedure \[10 minutes\]

1. Demonstrate your procedure for file submission. Use a handout or slide deck to illustrate this
   procedure.
2. Have students send a sample file to assess understanding of the procedure.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
Allow students to work in pairs if they are having trouble understanding the directions. Encourage
pairs to model the correct procedure for each other. Student helpers should point to areas on the
screen rather than typing or using the mouse to complete the action.


Teacher Prior CS Knowledge
--------------------------
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) are widely used in industry to develop software. Prior to
IDEs, software engineers used simple text editors to write programs. While teachers are welcome to
choose from a wide variety of IDEs (see <https://jaxenter.com/the-top-java-ides-114599.html> for a
comparison) or even use text editors, TEALS supports Eclipse in the AP CS A curriculum. Whichever
IDE/editor you choose, it’s a good idea to run through a few IDE tutorials to familiarize yourself
with the workflow before demonstrating to the class.


Teaching Tips
-------------
- Tips for Volunteers: <http://csteachingtips.org/Tips-for-classroom-volunteers>

- Tips for Reducing Bias: <http://csteachingtips.org/tips-for-reducing-bias>

- Class Introduction: Students will end up in your computer science class for a variety of reasons,
  here a few that are common:

  + My math teacher recommended I take computer science
  + My friend is in the class
  + I like computers
  + It fit in my schedule
  + It showed up in my schedule
  + It’s an AP class and would look good on my transcript
  + I build apps in my spare time

- By knowing the student’s motivation, you can better understand where the student is coming from. I
  use this information to inform the pace and depth of the initial lessons. I also try to determine
  the level of programming experience of each student. This helps with group formation in the
  beginning lessons where you try to pair experienced students with less experienced students to the
  students can learn from their peers.


Misconceptions
--------------
When introducing the Java programming language, many students will think Java is synonymous with
JavaScript. Although both are programing languages and many of the constructs are transferable
between the two languages, Java and JavaScript are two different languages. JavaScript is used today
for both client side web browser scripting to web servers. Java is used to create platform
independent apps meaning a program written in Java will run across a variety of operating systems.
