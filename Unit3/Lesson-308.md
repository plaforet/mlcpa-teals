Lesson 3.08 — Finding & Fixing Errors
====================================================================================================

Overview
--------
### Objectives — _Students will be able to…_
- **Find** errors in their returned homework assignments.
- **Correct** their previously submitted homework and classwork

### Assessments — _Students will…_
- **Re-submit** all homework assignments with corrected answers.

### Homework — _Students will…_
- **Read** BJP 4.1 up to “Nested if else Statements”
- **Complete** Chapter 4 self-check problems 1–6


Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Any student homework assignments** that you have not yet returned
- **Student self-help system** (such as C2B4 or student pairing)
- **Bookmarks** on students’ computers to webmaker.org

If you are not yet familiar with X-ray Goggles, Thimble, or Popcorn Maker, you should take some time
to explore [webmaker.org] before class. The site is rich with enrichment tools and hooks for your
classroom!

| Section                                | Total Time |
|----------------------------------------|-----------:|
| Bell-work and attendance               |       5min |
| Introduction and homework distribution |       5min |
| Student work                           |      35min |
| Students trade work, check, and submit |      10min |


Procedure
---------
Today we continue reinforcing concepts and applying the tools, procedures, and code that were
introduced last week. Students will have the opportunity to correct any incorrect homework
assignments. If students did not have time to finish the programming projects from yesterday, you
may allow them time to work on those projects today.

Reward students that did their work correctly with quiet free time. Alternatively, give them a fun
programming assignment to do, such as generating a meme, animations, gig posters, or comic strip on
Mozilla’s [Webmaker.org]. These activities teach HTML and CSS, so you might avoid them if you think
exploring different syntax will confuse your students.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Introduction and Homework Distribution \[5 minutes\]

1. Return student homework packets, or have students place their returned homework in a pile on
   their desk.

2. Explain to students that they have the opportunity to get full credit on their homework grades by
   correcting them now, in class. Ask students for suggestions/ideas on how to make sure they don’t
   miss any errors. (By now students should be used to relying on their error checklist/algorithm.)

### Student Work \[35 minutes\]
Have students work individually to correct their homework grades.
- Offer time checks for students so they stay on task.
- If students have not finished their programming project from yesterday’s class, allow them to do
  so today.

### Students trade work, check, and turn in \[10 minutes\]
At the end of class, have students trade their homework assignments to evaluate each other’s
corrections before submission.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
Students that don’t have corrections to make should be rewarded for their hard work with silent free
time. Encourage them to do work for another class, read the next chapter, or do a fun programming
project online.

If you have a student that appreciates public recognition, have them serve as your “TA” this class,
going around to help students correct their papers. Remind them to guide students through the
process instead of just giving them the answers.
