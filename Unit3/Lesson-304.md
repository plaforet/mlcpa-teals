Lesson 3.04 — Programming Project
====================================================================================================

Overview
--------
### Objectives — _Students will be able to…_
- **Write** a program that uses parameters, the math class, and returns values.

### Assessments — _Students will…_
- **Submit** an Equestria program by the end of class.

### Homework — _Students will…_
- **Read** BJP 3.3 up to “Interactive Programs and Scanner Objects”
- **Complete** Ch.3 self-check questions 18 & 19


Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Projector and computer** (if you are able to/opt to use Eclipse with your students)
- **White paper** **and** **markers**
- **Classroom copies** of [WS 3.4], [Equestria]
- **Classroom copies** of Algorithm for Solving Problems
- **Poster or image** of Equestria map with Cartesian coordinates (Poster 3.4)

The handout “Algorithm for Solving Problems” should be used/drilled every time the students are
asked to solve a larger, AP Test Section II – type problem. You may find it useful to make a
large-format poster to hang in your room so students always see the steps they should use to tackle
a large programming problem.

Procedure
---------
Over the next few weeks, we’ll be introducing students to larger programming projects to meet the AP
Computer Science A lab requirements. It is in your and your students’ best interest if you encourage
them to help themselves and each other before seeing you. Depending on the length of your class
periods, this lab may take 2 class periods to complete.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Introduction to Programming Project \[10 minutes\]

Begin with an introduction to today’s programming project.

- Students should complete this programming project individually. As a whole group, review the
  Algorithm for Solving Problems sheet. Read the sheet out loud, and briefly model the steps as you
  review the programming assignment. Read the programming assignment to the class, taking time to
  pause between each of the three requirements outlined in the question.

- Ask students what their very first steps should be according to the problem-solving algorithm.

- Require that pseudocode/comment documentation be submitted. Include these as part of the lab
  grade.

- Remind students to tackle one part of the problem at a time. It is OK if they leave pseudocode in
  while they solve a different part of the problem, and they don’t have to solve all of parts of the
  program in any particular order.

- They should refer to their notes, textbooks, and posters/work around the room to help them come up
  with ideas/solutions to programming problems.

- Sometimes it’s a good idea to step away from a problem for a few minutes if they’re stuck—work on
  a different method and return to where they were stuck later.

Student Programming Time \[45 minutes\]
---------------------------------------
In an email, on the projector, or as a handout (WS 3.4), give students the following questions to
work on individually, or in pairs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### PROGRAMMING PROJECT

##### Exercise 1
Princess Luna and Celestia are going on a tour of the kingdom to greet the other citizens of
Equestria. Their tour takes them on a circular path (shown on map). Write a method called roadTrip
that (1) accepts as a parameter the diameter of the circular path, and (2) returns the length of the
trip.

The equation for circumference is: C = dπ

Java has a math constant called `Math.PI`.

##### Exercise 2
Write a method called distance that (1) accepts four integer coordinates: x1, y1, x2, y2 as
parameters, (2) computes the distance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on the map, and (3)
returns that distance.

The equation for the distance is: sqrt ((x2 - x1)<sup>2</sup> + (y2 - y1)<sup>2</sup>).

Test out your program by writing a main method that calls the distance method for each of the
following pairs of cities. Your main method should output the value returned by the distance method.

1. Distance from Baltimare to Manehattan =

2. Distance from Los Pegasus to Neighagra Falls =

3. Distance from the Badlands to Ponyville =

##### Exercise 3
Write a program that helps Princess Luna plan a 3-stop tour of Equestria. Your program should prompt
the user (in this case Princess Luna) for three destinations in Equestria, as defined by their x and
y coordinates on the map. You program should output the distance between the three destinations.

You should use the distance methods you wrote for Exercise 2.

##### Exercise 4
Write a method called `totalTrip` that accepts parameters for 3 locations (each containing
coordinates) and returns the total distance traveled by visiting all 3 locations and returning to
the starting location. You should use the distance methods you wrote in Exercise 2 and you can
choose any 3 locations in Equestria.

Extra credit: make this program compute 4 locations instead!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
For students who complete the lab early, ask them to flesh out their program by adding a method that
will calculate the sum of the distances travelled between three cities in Exercise 2.

If you suspect that students will struggle with procedural decomposition, have them work in groups
to figure out a course of action before beginning. Procedural decomposition is one of the hardest
skills for students to acquire, so it is critical that you allow students to fight through the
process.

If additional scaffolding is needed, you might list all of the parts of the program, or have
students come up with the parts (“figure out how to write the equation in Java using the math
class,” “create some parameters to pass to a return method,” “write the framework for a method to
return the distance value”) out of order, then give the students some time to organize the steps
themselves. As a whole group, you can then come to consensus on what steps need to be approached,
and what order components should appear in the final program.
