### Assessments — _Students will…_
- **Re-submit** all homework assignments with corrected answers.

### Homework — _Students will…_
- **Study** for the test by:
  - **Reviewing** all the blue pages at the end of Chapters 3, 4, and 5
  - **Re-reading** sections as needed
- **Submit** 5 questions for review in class tomorrow using electronic survey


Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Any student homework assignments** that you have not yet returned
- **Student self-help system** (such as C2B4 or student pairing)

Pacing Guide

| Section                                | Total Time |
|----------------------------------------|-----------:|
| Bell-work and attendance               |       5min |
| Introduction and homework distribution |       5min |
| Student work                           |      35min |
| Students trade work, check, and submit |      10min |


Procedure
---------
Today, students will have the opportunity to correct any incorrect homework assignments. If students
did not have time to finish the programming projects from yesterday, you may allow them time to work
on those projects today.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Introduction and Homework Distribution \[5 minutes\]
1. Return student homework packets, or have students place their returned homeworks in a pile on
   their desk.

2. Explain to students that they have the opportunity to get full credit on their homework grades by
   correcting them now, in class. Ask students for suggestions/ideas on how to make sure they don’t
   miss any errors. (By now students should be used to relying on their error checklist/algorithm.)

### Student Work \[35 minutes\]
Have students work individually to correct their homework grades.
- Offer time checks for students so they stay on task.
- If students have not finished their programming project from yesterday’s class, allow them to do
  so today.

### Students trade work, check, and turn in \[10 minutes\]
At the end of class, have students trade their homework assignments to evaluate each other’s
corrections before submission.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
If you have students who are speeding through this lesson, you should encourage them to tackle
programming project 1 in Chapter 5.

If you were unable to finish grading student notebooks yesterday, finish them today while students
are working. Return notebooks by the end of class so students may use them to study for the exam.
