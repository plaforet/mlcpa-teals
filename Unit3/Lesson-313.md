Lesson 3.13 — while Loops
====================================================================================================

Overview
--------
### Objectives — _Students will be able to…_

  - The number of times the body executes
  - The output of the code
- **Differentiate** between while loops, if statements, and for loops

### Assessments — _Students will…_
- **Complete** Practice-It questions

### Homework — _Students will…_
- **Read** BJP 5.1 “Random Numbers”
- **Complete** self-check questions \#1-4 and exercise 2

Procedure
---------

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Introduction & Think-Pair-Share \[15 minutes\]

1. Ask students to offer pseudocode that explains how they might track damage to a Pokemon.

   - (Student answers should include some of these steps: Start with initial HP, and while HP is
     greater than 0, ask how much damage, subtract it, and end print with “Pokemon fainted!”) Point
     out that this process has no predetermined length (indefinite looping), so you need to use a
     new type of loop called a while loop.

   - If students need additional examples of indefinite looping, use a simpler example, asking
     students how they would double a number until it was bigger than N.

2. Engage students in the introduction today by having students complete the graphic organizer on
   WS 3.13 as you review the structure, flow, and syntax of the while loop.

3. Compare and contrast the while and for loops (see code snippets below): both are control
   structures that send the flow of control through a loop, but scope differs, so the loops execute
   in different ways.

   - Have students point out where i is declared.

   - Introduce the concept of definite vs. indefinite loops and ask students when they might want to
     use an indefinite loop (they will probably have wanted to use this structure in their earlier
     programming projects—prompt them with this if no one volunteers an example).

   - Call 2 students up to the board; one to trace the flow of control and the other write the
     output.

     ``` Java
     // while loop:                      // for loop:
     int i = 0;                          for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
     while (int i < 10) {                    System.out.println (i);
         System.out.println (i);         }
         i++;
     }
     ```

4. Invite students to Think-pair-share on the following example:

   ``` Java
   int n = 91;
   int factor = 2;
   while (n % factor != 0) {
       factor ++;
   }
   System.out.println("First factor is " + factor);
   ```

   - How many times does this loop execute? What is the output?

   - In the same pairs, have students rewrite the while loop as a for loop.

### Student Practice-It Activity \[35 minutes\]
1. Have students complete the following Practice-It problems:

   1. whileLoops<br>
   2. forToWhile<br>
   3. whileLoopMystery1<br>
   4. whileLoopMystery2

2. If students complete these problems with time to spare, have them complete Practice-It exercise
   “gcd.”


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
If students are having difficulty tracing while loops, using proper syntax, or predicting the output
of the loop, you can change the Practice-It exercise to a reciprocal teaching exercise, where ¼ of
the class does each problem, and they come to the front of the room to explain their solution and
process to the rest of the class.

If you have students that finished the classwork ahead of time, encourage them to explore do/while
loops (which are NOT part of the AP subset).
