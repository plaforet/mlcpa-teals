Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Projector and computer** (if you are able to/opt to use Eclipse with your students)
- **Whiteboard and** **markers**
- **Poster or image** of
  - Blastoise (<http://tinyurl.com/ndy3v69>) and
  - Raichu (<http://tinyurl.com/n2u5vn2>)

This lesson uses Pokémon code; you should read through the example and learn how stats work at
(<http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Stats>). The wiki offers a great amount of detail, and can
be used to offer additional programming challenges to advanced students. You may want to bookmark
this page for future reference, since Pokémon stats are used in future examples.

Procedure
---------
This lesson introduces methods that return values, and familiarizes students with the Math class.
You should hook students by introducing the Pokemon challenge (to be completed at the end of the
class); students will create more code to be used in their larger Pokemon program.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Review and Introduction to Returning Values \[15 minutes\]

1. Begin with a lecture/discussion about the Pokémon challenge and returning values.

   - When you’re playing a video game like Pokemon, part of the fun is the graphic images that help
     communicate the story of your battles, training, or travels. However, all of the outcomes of
     your game are determined by math that happens in the background.

   - The Pokemon with better stats wins a battle; some additional random numbers are thrown in to
     represent the unpredictable nature of the real world.

   - Today we’re going to learn how to write methods that **return a value**—we already know how to
     get Java to compute simple equations for us; now we’re going to learn how to get Java to give
     us back those numbers so we can use them elsewhere in our program.

     - While programmers can manipulate the parameters passed into a function, their code is
       operated on a copy of the value, and not the value itself.

     - If int x is passed as an argument into an expression as the parameter int num, the function
       may manipulate the value stored in num. When the function returns, x will be unchanged.

     - Students may find the following analogy from StackOverflow helpful: “The procedure defines a
       parameter, and the calling code passes an argument to that parameter. You can think of the
       **p**arameter as a **p**arking space, and the **a**rgument as an **a**utomobile.”

   - We’re also going to learn how to use a collection of equations that Java already has written
     for us called the Math Class. These pre-made methods make doing complex equations much easier!

2. Here’s the syntax to writing a method that returns the sum of numbers 1 – n; first the header:

   `public static `**`double`**` sum (double n) {`

   - We’re used to having “void” in this spot—but void actually means that we’re writing a method
     that we don’t expect to return anything. In this highlighted example, we write our method to
     return a value of the double type.

     `public static double `**`sum`**` (double n) {`

   - Highlighted is our method name, it goes in the same place in the header as it always did.

     `public static double sum (`**`double n`**`) {`

   - We used to just leave the highlighted section as empty parentheses, now we have to tell Java
     what type of type of data we’re going to put into the method (the formal parameter).

3. Ask students to change the method header so it sums data from input int data and returns data of
   the type int as well.

4. Ask students to change the method header so this new method is called doubleSum.

5. If students are adjusting these parts of the method header with ease, move onto the method body:

   ``` Java
   public static int sum (int n) {
       return (n + 1) * n / 2;
   ```

   - Without the special return statement, this wouldn’t return a value to the main method! It would
     basically be a void method, like the ones we wrote before. It is an error in Java for flow of
     control to reach the end of a non-void method without a return!

   - This method only makes sense if we have a main method that can pick up the value that we’re
     asking Java to return, so have students write a main method:

     ``` Java
     public static void main (string[] args) {    // a. Why is the main method void?
         int answer = sum (100);                  // b. What is this line doing?
         System.out.println ("The sum of 1 to 100 is" + " " + answer);
     ```

     1. The method main is void because it returns no value.
     2. This line is declaring & assigning a value to the variable `answer`.

6. Ask students to tell you where to place the brackets, and briefly review scope.

If they want to do fancier math, they can use the formulas that Java has already stored in the Math
class. As students read last night, there is a list of the most-used formulas in table 3.2 of the
book.

- There is special notation needed for the methods in the Math class, because you have to tell Java
  to go and use the method in another class. We call this “dot notation.”

- If you wanted to generate a random number to use in a formula for your Pokemon game (to add a
  little chance to a battle, lets say), you would create a method:

  ``` Java
  public static double pokemonRandom() {
      return Math.random() * 100;
  }
  ```

- The math class’ method random gives a random number between 0.0 and 1.0; we multiply it by 100
  because Pokemon random numbers are values between 0 and 100. This method now gives us a random
  number between 0 and 100. We can use our new pokemonRandom method whenever we need a random number
  from that range.

If students are getting the material, have them work independently on the Practice-It problems,
otherwise, work through the problems together as a whole class.

### Practice-It \[15 minutes\]
Have students work individually or in pairs to complete the following Practice-It self check
questions:

  1. parameterMysteryReturn
  2. mathExpressions2
  3. min


### Pokémon Challenge \[15 minutes\]
Once students have completed these exercises, invite them to complete the following Pokémon
challenge:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### POKEMON CHALLENGE:
A Pokémon’s base stat values will most often have the greatest influence over their specific stats
at any level. If we leave out individual values, effort values, and nature, a level 100 Pokémon’s
stats in Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, and Special Defense will be exactly 5 more than
double its base stat values in each, while the Hit Points (HP) stat will be 110 plus double the base
stat value (except in the case of Shedinja, whose HP is always 1).

Write a program that returns a Pokémon’s stats for Attack and HP at level 100. You should use
parameters and methods that return values for this program. You may choose to use the base stats for
Blastoise OR Raichu given here:

| Blastoise              | Raichu                |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------|
| _HP:_ 79               | _HP:_ 60              |
| _Attack:_ 83           | _Attack:_ 90          |
| _Defense:_ 100         | _Defense:_ 55         |
| _Special Attack:_ 85   | _Special Attack:_ 90  |
| _Special Defense:_ 105 | _Special Defense:_ 80 |
| _Speed:_ 78            | _Speed:_ 110          |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
For students who complete the Pokemon challenge early, ask them to flesh out their program by:

- Adding methods that return stats for Speed, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Defense.

- Writing a method that will compare stats between Blastiose and Raichu, then return the maximum
  value. (This program doesn’t need to accept user input –yet!)

If students are struggling with the Pokemon Challenge, urge them to begin with their structure
diagram of pseudocode. Once they have this code, help them write the method to calculate stats by
assisting with the algebra, if needed.


Misconceptions
--------------
- Output to the console is somehow synonymous with the return value of a method: overloading the use
  of the word output.
