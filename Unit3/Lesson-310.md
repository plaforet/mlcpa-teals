Procedure
---------
Your hook for today’s lesson is to turn the reins over to students immediately. Have instructions
printed out and sitting at team work stations (or on student desks). Make students answer their own
questions using the instruction sheet and text book.

### Student Practice \[20 minutes\]
Give students 20 minutes to prepare their presentation. Use a timer and periodically announce how
much time is left in class so students can pace themselves.

### Student Mini-Lessons \[15 minutes\]
1. Give students 5 minutes per team to present their topic.

2. Encourage students to ask questions, and be sure to ask a question or two of each team (depending
   on how many teams you have).

### Worksheet \[15 minutes\]
Leave about 10–15 minutes at the end of class for students to individually complete Practice-It
questions:

1. ifElseMystery1<br>
2. ifElseMystery2<br>
3. season


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
Circle around the room to help students through reading the text in the textbook. Make sure that
each of your working teams are properly stratified (rather than using tiered grouping).

If students are speeding along, encourage students to write down questions to pose to other groups
during mini-lessons.
